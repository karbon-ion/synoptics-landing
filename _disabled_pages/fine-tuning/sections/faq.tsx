        question: "What is fine-tuning in AI?",
        answer: "Fine-tuning involves adapting a pre-trained AI model to perform specific tasks more effectively by training it further on a targeted dataset."
    },
    {
        question: "Why fine-tune a model?",
        answer: "Fine-tuning enhances a model's performance on specialised tasks, making it more accurate and relevant to applications."
    },
    {
        question: "What are the benefits of fine-tuning an AI model?",
        answer: "Benefits include improved task-specific performance, reduced training costs compared to building models from scratch, and the ability to incorporate domain-specific knowledge."
    },
    {
        question: "What kind of data is needed to fine-tune an LLM?",
        answer: "High-quality, domain-specific data that accurately represents the language and scenarios of the intended application is essential for effective fine-tuning."
    },
    {
        question: "How do you ensure secure fine-tuning and confidentiality throughout the process?",
        answer: "Implementing strict data handling protocols, encryption, and access controls ensures data security and confidentiality during the fine-tuning process."
